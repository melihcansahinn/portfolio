## Responsive Design Explanation and Examples;

- Root variables have been set for all css variables.( font-size, width, height etc. )
- Only ````@media screen and (orientation: portrait)```` has been used for portrait dimensions.

- ````width: calc(100vh / (412 / var(--res-sticky-info-width)));````
